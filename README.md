Java, JDBC, jsp, css

Proposed an efficient group key transfer protocol based on secret sharing. 
Every user needs to register at a trusted KGC initially and pre share a secret with KGC. 
KGC broadcasts group key information to all group members at once. 
The confidentiality of our group key distribution is information theoretically secure.
